## Background
This project was developed as part of a school assignment during the 2021/2022 academic year. The primary goal was to explore Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and experiment with various technologies.

As a learning exercise, the app includes features like location access, text-to-speech, and content sharingâ€”not necessarily because they were essential, but to gain hands-on experience with them. Since the focus was on experimentation, certain aspects, such as image handling, authentication, and user management, were not prioritized or fully implemented. This project is intended purely for educational purposes.
